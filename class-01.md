## Reading 01

### Structure

HTML is a system meant to organize documents in a readable way that can be shared with other users. It is similar to a newpaper, magazine, or even any forms you read and fill out each day. It follows similar rules and uses similar ideas, but must be done in a way that a computer can understand. It can be organized into large blocks that these real world examples also use, including but not limited to: A header, a body, articles, asides, and a footer.

### `<h3>`Extra Markup`</h3>`

`<p>`
`<span class="catchyOpener">`Markup is the set of tools HTML uses to do its organizing.`</span>`The documents, or `<i>`*webpages*`</i>`, are organized using hidden dividing flags, or `<i>`*containers*`</i>`, that separate out content both for the author's organization and later on for the presentation of the page. These containers sometimes even hold information that is never shown at all, but instead is used to hold information relevant to the webpage for accessiblity both by users with non-typical browsers, and older browsers.

### HTML5 Layout

As briefly mentioned in the Structure section, HTML5 makes use of more specific tags meant for specific uses, rather than using general dividing tags such as the `<div></div>` tag. These tags have additional meaning to both the user and the browser itself, providing a sort of skeleton or map to more easily browse the page. A screen-reader, for example, may be set to look for the navigation portion of the page to help the user find the correct page of your website. However, without the `<nav>navigation</nav>` tag, the screen-reader may not be able to distinguish what it is meant to be focusing on.

### Process and Design

When actually designing a webpage, it is important to understand your users to better organize the website. Your users may have very specific goals in mind, especially if your website is meant to fulfill a specialized role. Your organization, and design, must work toward that purpose. Additionally, the visual design can more subtly guide a user to where they need to go without them realizing it- Perhaps even to your benefit as a developer. It is important to form a map with the paths you expect users to take, and have a sketch of what you imagine the site will look like so that you are able to prepare the HTML tags ahead of time in a way that will allow you to design the site easily.

### ABC of Programming

The structure of code, irregardless of language, is most easily understood (for me) as a flowchart of instructions. A computer reading the code will move forward in a linear path down the instructions, acting on every step along the way. Some steps may be conditional, similar to the arrows in a flowchart that direct to multiple options, or even back to a previous step. These flowchart steps can hold information at times, affecting the decisions the computer will make when deciding on what path to take down the flowchart.
