## Reading 01

### <h3>Structure</h3>

`<span class="catchyOpener">`HTML is a format for documents to be organized and shared.`</span>` The documents, or webpages, are organized using hidden dividing flags, or containers, that separate out content both for the author's organization and later on for the presentation of the page. These containers sometimes even hold information that is never shown at all, but instead is used to hold information relevant to the webpage for accessiblity both by users with non-typical browsers, and older browsers.

### ABC of Programming

The structure of code, irregardless of language, is most easily understood (for me) as a flowchart of instructions. A computer reading the code will move forward in a linear path down the instructions, acting on every step along the way. Some steps may be conditional, similar to the arrows in a flowchart that direct to multiple options, or even back to a previous step. These flowchart steps can hold information at times, affecting the decisions the computer will make when deciding on what path to take down the flowchart.
