## Reading 04

### Links

Your documents can contain links guiding a user (when clicked) to other websites, other pages of your website, other *parts* of your webpage or parts of another page entirely as well. You can also link to an email. The href tag for linking to a local page was most interesting to me, being something like `index.html` for the target instead of a URL which was confusing to me before. You can also control whether it opens in new page or not via _blank after the destination in the tag.

### Layout A

CSS uses blocks to contain HTML elements (which can contain other elements). These stack from top down, and when inline from left to right. When positioning elements, there are a few different schemes available. The default is normal flow. Relative positioning moves the element around in its position without breaking flow, in its defined space. Absolute positioning forces the element out of flow and into an exact spot on the page. Fixed positioning is similar to absolute, but attaches the element to the user's screen, and travels as they scroll. Floating allows other elements to flow around the floating element.

### Functions,~Methods, Objects~ A

Functions are sections of code that can be defined and then called at a later point, potentially multiple times. They can be attached to logic, or variables, or even give value to variables depending on their output just like anything else. They can recieve and  output information as well which is defined inside the variable (Such as a calculator that takes in numbers and outputs results).

### Reasons for Pair Programming

Pair programming, which I suspect we're about to do in this upcoming class (ref. 2/21)(Result:_), is a method wherein two programmers take up different roles. One writes the mechanical small details while the other handles the overarching structure. This is similar to micro vs macro strategies. The following are skills for this method:
-Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary
-Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea
-Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey
-Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful, well structured solution
The purpose of this is to develop the skills above, as well as learning: Being more efficient, collaborating with partners, learning other perspectives and styles, developing social skills, preparing for collaborative job interviews, and preparing us for a real world work environment.
