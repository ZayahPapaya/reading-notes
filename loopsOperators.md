## Loops

In JS, loops are possible. There's a set of them that each have some different uses, but their primary function is in the name. They're code that loops a number of times instead of continuing down the script, iterating on the same code until it is finished. It may never finish, if written in such a way. A for loop, for example,  continues until its conditions are false. If the conditions are never false, then it never stops. A do while loop is similar in that it will continue until false, but will occur at least once even if the conditions are already met. A while loop is sort of the opposite of a for loop in that it continues so long as it remains true. It's more of a status check than for?
