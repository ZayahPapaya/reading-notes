**Notes**
1. pwd is present working directory, ie: current folder/directory
2. ls is list, listing current contents of pwd
3. cd [directory_name] is a case sensitive command to change directory, opening that directory/folder
4. cd .. to move up a level
5. cd ../.. to link multiple movements
6. mkdir is to make a directory
7. cp for copy
8. mv for move | syntax is mv [target] [destination]
9. These directories are just the folder system. Move up and down them, move horizontally in current folder. Works identical to GUI version, but without visuals. 
10. Commands are exactly the same as user interface. I expect all user commands have cmd equivalents.
