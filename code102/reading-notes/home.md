This is where I'll be taking notes for the duration of my time at Code Fellows, and potentially later on in my development as a developer. Things may get a bit complicated, and this is written in a format that is intended to be similar to a diary or even simply a stream of thought. It is, in no way, meant to be informative for others or entertaining to read, but instead a way for me to solidify things that I have learned and review later.
