## Reading 05

### Images

Images can be added to your webpage and manpipulated with some fairly simple tools. Multiple types can be included, starting with PNG, JPEG, and GIFs. The editing of these images is pretty limited and not going to get you far, edit outside the webpage.

### Color

We have the full usual color tools of other apps I have used. Color, opacity, saturation, brightness/contrast, and the different areas to color (Foreground, background, and the element).

### Text

As usual, we have all of the markdown tools at our disposal in our markdown language as well as a few  goodies like hover-over information and shadows. All fairly simple stuff.
