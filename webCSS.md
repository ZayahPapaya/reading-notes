## Web Design using CSS

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that goes hand in hand with HTML to present your content in a more appealing manner than bland text on a plain white page similarly to a notebook. It applies rules and changes to specific tags that you've applied using HTML, allowing you to carefully specify exactly what you'll be altering. These flags are generally organizational containers like 'body', 'head', 'footer', or 'div', but can become much more useful with classes added to them. A div class="Test" and second div class="Alt" would be able to both be affected by rules that apply to div elements, but could be changed individually by referring to their specific classes. With some tinkering and creativity, CSS can make a webpage look quite appealing.
