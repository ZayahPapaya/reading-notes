## Revisions and the Cloud

  Today we've gone over version control, both indirectly and directly in teaching. We're using git and github as our method, which has been quite interesting to learn about. The excitement when my terminal produced results after modifying and pushing a file was greater than I'd expected.
  
  In short, Github manages our work in a sort of container in the cloud that any authorized device can access. This can be edited directly on github and then commited just as usual. However, the contents of our work can be saved locally, written and edited offline, and later synched up with the current master copy with a changelog of the work done while away. While this is convenient alone, it's vital for larger projects with multiple users that all need to be able to read and write collective code and upload to the master copy.
  
  Our work today was preparing our computers to be able to interact in this way with github and our projects, which will set us up down the line both for our future projects and later careers. The process was messy and everyone's problems were unique, which has forced a sort of mindset of 'work it out as you go' and requires some tenacity. *Whoops.*
