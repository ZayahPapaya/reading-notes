## Learning HTML

HTML, similar to markdown, has been relatively easy for me to pick up. It was at the start, and it was now after having already taken the 101 course. My notes here will be terse for now but still explain what exactly I've learned, followed by some of the information revisited that I needed a refresher on.

HTML is a language designed purely for organizing content on a webpage that can be viewed by a browser. It's fairly barebones, and without CSS to support it it is terrible to actually view. Much of it so far has simply been flags for organizing said content to refer to later via CSS, or even simply for organizing for the human behind the screen attempting to fill out the content in a reasonable timeframe. HTML itself is surprisingly simple, though there are some tricks to it such as including alt text for images for users that may not be able to view the image itself and need a description, such as those with a screen reader.

Not new to me, but still a welcome refresher, was the coverage on the frameworks we built for a website, also known as wireframes. These are sketches laid out as a sort of rudimentary blueprint, or simply a sketch similar to art, to keep in mind where you intend for content to go in an ideal situation. CSS will later make this wireframe a reality, or at least close to it, but it provides the information needed when designing the HTML side of a page to properly flag and organize its contents for the later design steps. If the HTML is not correctly flagged at first, it may have to be redone at a later point anyway for the CSS side to do its job.
