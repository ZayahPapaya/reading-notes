## Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight language that is intended primarily for use in websites, but can find use in other applications as well. It uses variables and events to produce outputs via your scripts. It functions similarly to algebra in concept, though the "math" does not always act in the same way. For example, if X = cat and Y = dog, then X + Y = catdog. Strings of information can be added in this way. Additionally, logic can be performed based around variables, such as a simple "If X = cat, Y = dog" (In concept, at least. This is not an accurate representation of the code.)

let X = 'cat';
let Y = 'dog';
alert(X + Y);

The output will be catdog.

Additionally in our reading we were shown videos about how computers function, moving from the most fundamental components that make it all work, up to the software we're developing in this class. A computer is, simply put, arrays of electrical signals being registered as 'on' or 'off', and logic gates making simple calculations at a time with these signals. Logic gates chained together can perform more complicated tasks in layers, which then link together to form even more complicated tasks. These signals are binary, and everything can be represented with binary. Moreso, anything can be represented through numbers- But binary can represent those numbers. The software we write is not at all binary, nor even close, but instead interpreted by the foundational software and operating systems of our computers prepared for us ahead of time. I don't think I'd be interested in software development still if it meant writing everything in binary.
