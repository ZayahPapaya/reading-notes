## Programmmming with JavaScript

JavaScript runs similarly to sheet music, or more simply a set of instructions. Its 'attention' moves down your code from top to bottom, completing code as it moves until it reaches an obstacle, a loop, or the end. In the event of a loop, it will go through that loop however long is required (up to and including forever) before moving on, if it ever does. This can be very useful when leaving "flags" for debugging to check how far along your code will run before it encounters the issue you are trying to find. You must be mindful, however, to write in any required variables first so that they are defined before the code that refers to them is ran.

Functions are sets of code that are not run with the rest, and instead are prepared and set aside for when they are called. Another event, perhaps a button press, will call this function to then run through its script to completion just like a normal script. It can be repeated, and called more than once.

Operators are simply math operators. Addition, subtraction, and the like. They can work a bit strangely in the case of strings, where 2 + 2 may very well be 22 for once.
