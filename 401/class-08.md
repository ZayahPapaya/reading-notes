## RBAC

The concept behind RBAC is straightforward and both the article and Wikipedia page reinforce this. Assign your users and staff roles and give those roles permissions relevant to their needs. Restricting access to data, limiting potentially harmful actions to only those with the authority to do so, or simply providing data necessary for a given role or job. The article makes sure to state that this should be a somewhat generic system, and not to create one-off or niche roles else the system will easily become too convoluted to support.

Examples of this may be: Administrator, moderator, user - Back-end staff, front-end staff, security staff.
