## Open Source Contribution

Contributing to open-source projects is a great way to, like any other trade or skill, experience methods and approaches to your coding skills that are  otherwise unfamiliar or unusual to you. You might pick up new coding patterns, new tricks or shortcuts, or maybe even teach others your own. It's also an avenue to expand your network and meet other developers through their work (and yours).
