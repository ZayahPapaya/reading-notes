## Graphs

Graphs are the ultimate form of the linked object data-structures we've been looking at up to this point, being a linked list or tree that follows little to no rules. Nodes that connect to nodes (one-way or bi-directional) using connection objects called edges. They do not have the same restrictive, but helpful, rules as binary trees where nodes may have any number of neighbors or none at all, may cycle back to themselves in one or more steps, and may not even be one cohesive web with two separate graphs in a single data structure.
