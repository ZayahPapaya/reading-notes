## My unique skills

My personal strength and unique skill is my adaptation, I believe! I've always been able to pick up something new and unfamiliar and grasp it quickly, and apply it very soon after. I have proven that I can open up an entirely new project, dive into it, and learn enough to debug it despite unfamiliarity.

## Spinning tires

- Clarify what the problem is. It is difficult to solve a problem if I'm not sure what exactly is causing it. Console.logs do this quite well, narrowing down where the issue has occurred and maybe even why through context.
- Research the problem. I am very unlikely to encounter an entirely unique issue, so others before me have likely encountered and solved it online.
- Ask for help. It sounds like given but opening up enough to ask for help can be difficult, but necessary. Having teammates and friends is vital to have access to other perspectives and ways of thinking.
