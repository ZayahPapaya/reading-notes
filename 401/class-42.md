## Ethics

I think ethics in software development are beyond important with our society so deeply intertwined with technology that we as developers will be writing for. Either something mundane like a storefront, or a little more out of the ordinary like deciding when a self-driving car will swerve and when it will not. There's a lot to consider and sometimes there's simply no correct answer, but it's on us to choose. More realistically, we'll have our hands in systems where inclusion of others in our society will be critical. Things like light-sensitive faucets unable to detect dark skin, or lack of accessibility for people with disabilities. We will be in a position to fix these things, or avoid problems like them in the future, so long as we are mindful of our impact on others through code.
