## Reading 02

### Text

Using a small variety of simple tags, text can be edited using HTML. This includes simple details like bold, italics, underline, and strikethrough. It also includes a hover-over preview for abbreviations, formatting for contact information, and formatting for quotes.

### Intro to CSS

CSS allows you to write rules and display changes that target specific tags, either in groups or individually named tags. The actual rules are made using a target tag, the rule, and the values of that rule.

### Basic JS

JavaScript is made up of scripts that perform step by step actions and instructions. Most notably to me are variables, which are first defined as a value to remember and then given the value. These variable values can be modified, both directly changing their value and using a variety of operators on them such as mathmatical ones, logical checks and comparisons, and simply redefining them.

### Decisions and Loops

Loops can make decisions for your code, although you must write the logic for it of course. This logic usually compares one or more values to a fixed value or each other to determine whether they are true, false, or if there are multiple options and one or more are 'correct'. These can be chained together for complicated decision-making.
