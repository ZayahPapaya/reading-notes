Hello, World!

Welcome, me, to my *notes, but italics sometimes.*

01b - Learning Markdown

**Growth Mindset:** 
A growth mindset is being prepared to adapt, learn, and take in others' experiences to improve your own. Part of the human experience. Ideally.
1. Listen to critique from others, even if it's frustrating.
2. Realize that others succeeding means wisdom to be learned from.
3. Something exploding happens. Looking into how, and why, is where you grow.

**Stretch Goals
Beef up your profile page! Add an image, a bio, contact infoâ€¦ as much as you feel comfortable including. Remember, this page will act as a showcase of your developer skills, so make it look great!**-->

I'm current deployment lol
[Test](revisionsCloud.md)

**Notes**
1. pwd is present working directory, ie: current folder/directory
2. ls is list, listing current contents of pwd
3. cd [directory_name] is a case sensitive command to change directory, opening that directory/folder
4. cd .. to move up a level
5. cd ../.. to link multiple movements
6. mkdir is to make a directory
7. cp for copy
8. mv for move | syntax is mv [target] [destination]
9. These directories are just the folder system. Move up and down them, move horizontally in current folder. Works identical to GUI version, but without visuals. 
10. Commands are exactly the same as user interface. I expect all user commands have cmd equivalents.
