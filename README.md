Hello, World!

Welcome, me, to my *notes, but italics sometimes.*

01b - Learning Markdown

**Growth Mindset:** 
A growth mindset is being prepared to adapt, learn, and take in others' experiences to improve your own. Part of the human experience. Ideally.
1. Listen to critique from others, even if it's frustrating.
2. Realize that others succeeding means wisdom to be learned from.
3. Something exploding happens. Looking into how, and why, is where you grow.

**Stretch Goals
Beef up your profile page! Add an image, a bio, contact infoâ€¦ as much as you feel comfortable including. Remember, this page will act as a showcase of your developer skills, so make it look great!**-->

## Home
This is where I'll be taking notes for the duration of my time at Code Fellows, and potentially later on in my development as a developer. Things may get a bit complicated, and this is written in a format that is intended to be similar to a diary or even simply a stream of thought. It is, in no way, meant to be informative for others or entertaining to read, but instead a way for me to solidify things that I have learned and review later.
