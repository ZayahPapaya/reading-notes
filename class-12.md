### Canvas

Canvas is a defined area with dimensional context (2d or 3d) that can display a design that can be drawn in JavaScript. It operates on a grid of coordinates, typically corrosponding to pixels. Canvas can draw rectangles, and straight line segments. These line segments are made with a beginning at set coordinates, point-to-point lines, and then possibly filling in its area. CSS can, additionally, be applied to components of canvas for colors, width, and shape. Text can also be placed inside the canvas itself.
