## Things I want to know more about

### Functional Programming Concepts

  1 What is functional programming? "Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data" - Wikipedia
  2 What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? A function that returns the same result if given the same arguments / deterministic, and does not cause observable side effects.
  3 What are the benefits of a pure function? They are stable, consistent, and predictable.
  4 What is immutability? The state cannot be changed after it's created. (See; const).
  5 What is Referential transparency? The concept that a constant input means a constant output.

### Node JS

  1 What is a module? Single task code blocks that are only used when called. Effectively larger scale functions as files.
  2 What does the word ‘require’ do? Tells our app that we must have a file accessible.
  3 How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in? module.export, just like React
  4 What do we have to do to make a module available? let functionName = require(fileName)
