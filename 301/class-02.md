## Things I want to know more about

### React Lifecycle

  1: Render first
  2: Constructor
  3: Constructor -> Render -> ComponentDidMount -> componentWillUnmount
  4: Used for loading network requests, or initialize the DOM immediately after component is mounted.

### React State Vs Props

  1: Pass information similarly to a function, information from "above" to initialize the component
  2: Props are passed into a component, and state is handled inside the component
  3: When the state changes
  4: Anything that should be able to change actively inside the component.
