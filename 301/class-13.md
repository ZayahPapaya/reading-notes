## Things I want to know more about

### CRUD

CRUD, in my own words, is the concept of how to operate on information storage remotely. Create, Read, Update, and Delete are the simplest actions one can take on information that we do each day. Create files, return the information inside files, update those files, or delete files entirely. (Update may delete content inside those files by definition as Github so aptly displays in commits). A database and your interactions with it will need these four tools at heart to operate on your data in every way that you'll require.
