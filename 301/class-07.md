## Things I want to know more about

### REST

Roy fielding wrote the first web servers, and helped write HTTP protocols.
Machines were built to only communicate directly to small groups, rather than finding resources that may be on a different machine than the one they're calling.
HTTP acts as coordinates / flags for information
GET calls for information from a destination
POST writes to a destination
PUT overwrites to a destination
PATCH partially updates information, or patches.
