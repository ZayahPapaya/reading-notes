## Things I want to know more about

### Diversity

Deciding to write this one off the cuff rather than the few questiosn presented, once more. Diversity to me (and in the article) is relevant both for the peoples' sake and for productivity. Different mindsets, different perspectives, and different outlooks on life all are great for a team to cover as much ground as possible and to be able to solve more problems that may arise where an individual or individual mindset would struggle. On the people side of things, the initial article covering 'That Time When Women Stopped Coding' points out painful flaws in modern society revolving around gender norms that ought to be abolished entirely, and not just with computers. Your line of work, the devices you use, the clothes you wear, and most other aspects of life, don't particularly care what genitals you were born with nor should they at any point.

Another perspective that this article does not cover in a way that I believe is relevant is computers in recreation for women. The gaming industry is a major source of recreation and entertainment involving computers, but even for those women that engage in it the environment is outright hostile: Male players typically harass female players and can even turn outright creepy or dangerous via stalking or illegal activites. Can confirm, I certainly face harassment plenty myself and I don't even have voice to worry about!
