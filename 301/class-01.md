## Things I want to know more about

  This topic relates to the assignments we also did for prework that handle these things, and one or the other of the assignments is redundant or should be merged into the other. On a more topical type discussion; Components and props are built into React which is the library we will be learning about and working with shortly. They're the fundamentals, and we need to learn about them.

### Component-Based Architecture

  1: Components are modular parts of a greater whole that recieve, process, and push forward data. They function similarly to functions, and in my eyes are identical to Factorio modular segments.
  2: Reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, independent
  3: Ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, independent

### What is Props and How to Use it in React

  1: Props is prop(ertie)s
  2: "...passing data from one component to another."
  3: "uni-directional flow." / One-way
