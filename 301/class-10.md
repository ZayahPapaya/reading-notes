## Things I want to know more about

### JS Call Stack

  1. A call is a function call to occur.

  2. One call at a time

  3. Last in, first out. Works like the MTG stack.

  4. `summons = () => {
    firstFun()
    secondFun()
    thirdFun()
    }

  5. Arbitrarily large or endless loops of function calls that exceed browser memory forms a stack overflow.

### Errors

  1. Referrence error means your reference cannot be found. You typo'd your variable or it was never defined at this point.

  2. Syntax is incorrect = syntax error.

  3. Range error is when an object has invalid length

  4. > What is a ‘tyep error’?
  lol, typo aside. A tyep error is when the types of data are incompatible, such as undefined in just about anything.

  5. Breakpoints artificially halt your code where you choose.

  6. Debugger adds a breakpoint.
