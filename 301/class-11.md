## Things I want to know more about

### SQL and NoSQL

SQL and NoSQL are the two opposites of data storage. SQL databases store data in tables where data has many rows of datapoints with limited data in those rows, while NoSQL does not actually care and may store a lot more data on a given document instead of table row. The two have very different roles in where they work best, as well as different weaknesses. NoSQL can search by relational data, such as our REGEX queries that look for a pattern of data. SQL on the other hand requires specific search locations in the database.
