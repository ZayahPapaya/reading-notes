## Things I want to know more about

### Thinking in React

  1: Like functions, components should only do one thing each
  2: No state, only harcoded props
  3: Identify minimum UI
  4: Is it passed in from a parent via props? Does it remain unchanged over time? Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?
  5: The "lowest" possible component while still reaching all children components that require the state.

### Higher-Order Functions

  1: Functions that operate upon other functions. Take them as args or return them.
  2: Sets m to value and checks if new value is greater  than previous value
  3: Map can call and 'use' a function on each of its values as it progresses.
